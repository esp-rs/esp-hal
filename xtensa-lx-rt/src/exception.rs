//! Exception handling
//!
//! Currently specialized for ESP32 (LX6) configuration: which extra registers
//! to store, how many interrupt levels etc.
//!
//! First level interrupts and exceptions save full processor state to the user
//! stack. This includes the coprocessor registers contrary to the esp-idf where
//! these are lazily saved. (Kernel mode option is currently not used.)
//!
//! WindowUnder/Overflow and AllocA use default Xtensa implementation.
//!
//! LoadStoreError and Unaligned are not (yet) implemented: so all accesses to
//! IRAM must be word sized and aligned.
//!
//! Syscall 0 is not (yet) implemented: it doesn't seem to be used in rust.
//!
//! Double Exceptions can only occur during the early setup of the exception
//! handler. Afterwards PS.EXCM is set to 0 to be able to handle
//! WindowUnderflow/Overflow and recursive exceptions will happen instead.
//!
//! In various places call0 are used as long jump: `j.l` syntax is not supported
//! and `call0` can always be expanded to `mov a0,label; call a0`. Care must be
//! taken since A0 is overwritten.
