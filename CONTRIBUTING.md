## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Create a New Issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists]. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using the [issue form].

[search if an issue already exists]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments
[issue form]: https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/issues/new/

#### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues] to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

It's recommended that you comment in the relevant issue, mentioning that you are actively working on it, however this is not a requirement.

If somebody is already assigned to an issue, this does not necessarily mean they are actively working on it; don't be afraid to comment in these issues asking if you can take over the work if you're interested.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
   - Using GitHub Desktop:
     - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop] will guide you through setting up Desktop.
     - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo!]
   - Using the command line:
     - [Fork the repo] so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Install or update to the latest version of Rust. See [rustup.rs] for more information.
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit Your Update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

We ask that you ensure all source code files has been properly formatted with `rustfmt`, and that you have linted your changes by running `cargo clippy`. These tools can be installed by running the following commands:

```shell
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup component add clippy
```

We _strongly_ recommend that you use the supplied `pre-commit` Git hook, which will ensure that all source code has been formatted correctly prior to committing. See the [Git documentation] for more information on hooks.

The `pre-commit` hook can be installed by running the following command in a terminal, from the root of the repository:

```shell
cp pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the pull request template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue] if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits] so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes] or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved].
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial] to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
