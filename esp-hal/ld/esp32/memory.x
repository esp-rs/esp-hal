     The 0x20 offset is a convenience for the app binary image generation.
     Flash cache has 64KB pages. The .bin file which is flashed to the chip
     has a 0x18 byte file header, and each segment has a 0x08 byte segment
     header. Setting this offset makes it simple to meet the flash cache MMU's
     constraint that (paddr % 64KB == vaddr % 64KB).)
