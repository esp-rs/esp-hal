//! # Hardware and Software Reset
//!
//! ## Overview
//! The Hardware and Software Reset module provides functions for performing
//! hardware and software resets on ESP chips. It also includes functions for
//! retrieving the reset reason and the wakeup cause after a reset.
//!
//! The module defines a set of sleep sources (`SleepSource`) that indicate the
//! source of the wakeup event. These sources include:
//!     - external signals
//!     - timers
//!     - touchpads
//!     - ULP programs
//!     - GPIOs
//!     - UART
//!     - Wi-Fi
//!     - COCPU interrupts
//!     - BT (Bluetooth)
//!
//! The module also includes a set of flags (`WakeupReason`) that represent
//! different wakeup sources and enable/disable wakeup triggers for specific
//! events such as:
//!     - GPIO
//!     - timers
//!     - UART
//!     - touch sensors
//!     - ULP
//!     - Wi-Fi
//!     - BT
