//! LCD
//!
//! ## Overview
//! The LCD module is designed to send parallel video data signals, and its bus
//! supports RGB, MOTO6800, and I8080 interface timing.
//!
//! For more information on these modes, please refer to the documentation in
//! their respective modules.
//!
//! ## Implementation State
//! - RGB is not supported yet
