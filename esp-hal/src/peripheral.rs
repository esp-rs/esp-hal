//! # Exclusive peripheral access

/// Creates a new `Peripherals` struct and its associated methods.
///
/// The macro has a few fields doing different things, in the form of
/// `second <= third (fourth)`.
/// - The second field is the name of the peripheral, as it appears in the
///   `Peripherals` struct.
/// - The third field is the name of the peripheral as it appears in the PAC.
///   This may be `virtual` if the peripheral is not present in the PAC.
/// - The fourth field is an optional list of interrupts that can be bound to
///   the peripheral.
