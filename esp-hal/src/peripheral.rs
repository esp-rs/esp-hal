//! # Exclusive peripheral access
//!
//! ## Overview
//! The Peripheral module provides an exclusive access mechanism to peripherals
//! on ESP chips. It includes the `PeripheralRef` struct, which represents an
//! exclusive reference to a peripheral. It offers memory efficiency benefits
//! for zero-sized types.
//!
//! The `PeripheralRef` struct is used to access and interact with peripherals.
//! It implements the `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits, allowing you to dereference
//! it to access the underlying peripheral. It also provides methods for cloning
//! and re-borrowing the peripheral.
//!
//! The module also defines the `Peripheral` trait, which is implemented by
//! types that can be used as peripherals. The trait allows conversion between
//! owned and borrowed peripherals and provides an unsafe method for cloning the
//! peripheral. By implementing this trait, a type can be used with the
//! `PeripheralRef` struct.
//!
//! The module also includes a `peripheral_macros` module, which contains macros
//! for generating peripheral structs and associated traits based on
//! configuration options.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### Initialization
//! ```no_run
//! let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
//! ```
//! ### Accessing peripherals
//! ```no_run
//! let mut rtc = Rtc::new(peripherals.LPWR, None);
//! ```
//! ```no_run
//! let io = Io::new(peripherals.GPIO, peripherals.IO_MUX);
//! ```

/// is zero-sized. PeripheralRef stores a copy of `T` instead, so it's the same

///         twim: impl Peripheral<P = T> + 'd,

///         config: Config,
///     ) -> Self { .. }

/// ```

/// live forever (`'static`):
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut twi: Twim<'static, ...> = Twim::new(p.TWISPI0, irq, p.P0_03, p.P0_04, config);

/// Or you may call it with borrowed peripherals, which yields an instance that
/// can only live for as long as the borrows last:
