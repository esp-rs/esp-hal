//! # MCPWM peripheral - timer module
//!
//! ## Overview
//! The `timer` module is a part of the `MCPWM (Motor Control Pulse Width
//! Modulator)` driver for ESP chips. It provides an interface to configure and
//! use timers for generating `PWM` signals used in motor control and other
//! applications.
