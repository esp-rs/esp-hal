//! # Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)
//!
//! I2C is a serial, synchronous, multi-device, half-duplex communication
//! protocol that allows co-existence of multiple masters and slaves on the
//! same bus. I2C uses two bidirectional open-drain lines: serial data line
//! (SDA) and serial clock line (SCL), pulled up by resistors.
