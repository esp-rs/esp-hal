//! # Peripheral Instances
//!
//! This module creates singleton instances for each of the various peripherals,
//! and re-exports them to allow users to access and use them in their
//! applications.
//!
//! Should be noted that that the module also re-exports the [Interrupt] enum
//! from the PAC, allowing users to handle interrupts associated with these
//! peripherals.

// We need to export this for users to use
