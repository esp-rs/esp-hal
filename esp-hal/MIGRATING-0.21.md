# Migration Guide from 0.21.x to v0.22.x

## Removed `i2s` traits

The following traits have been removed:

- `I2sWrite`
- `I2sWriteDma`
- `I2sRead`
- `I2sReadDma`
- `I2sWriteDmaAsync`
- `I2sReadDmaAsync`

You no longer have to import these to access their respective APIs. If you used these traits
in your functions as generic parameters, you can use the `I2s` type directly instead.

For example:

```diff
-fn foo(i2s: &mut impl I2sWrite) {
+fn foo(i2s: &mut I2s<'_, I2S0, Blocking>) {
     // ...
 }
```

## Peripheral types are now optional

You no longer have to specify the peripheral instance in the driver's type for the following
peripherals:

- SPI (both master and slave)
- I2S

```diff
-Spi<'static, SPI2, FullDuplexMode>
+Spi<'static, FullDuplexMode>

-SpiDma<'static, SPI2, HalfDuplexMode, Blocking>
+SpiDma<'static, HalfDuplexMode, Blocking>

-I2sTx<'static, I2S0, Async>
+I2sTx<'static, Async>
```

Note that you may still specify the instance if you need to. To do this, we provide `_typed`
versions of the constructors (for example: `new_typed`, `new_half_duplex_typed`). Please note that
the peripheral instance has been moved to the last generic parameter position.

```rust
let spi: Spi<'static, FullDuplexMode, SPI2> = Spi::new_typed(peripherals.SPI2, 1.MHz(), SpiMode::Mode0);
```

## No need to include `rom_functions.x` manually

Don't include `rom_functions.x` from esp-wifi

```diff
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-Tlinkall.x",
-    "-C", "link-arg=-Trom_functions.x",
]
```
