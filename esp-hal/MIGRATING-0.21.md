# Migration Guide from 0.21.x to v0.22.x

## Removed `i2s` traits

The following traits have been removed:

- `I2sWrite`
- `I2sWriteDma`
- `I2sRead`
- `I2sReadDma`
- `I2sWriteDmaAsync`
- `I2sReadDmaAsync`

You no longer have to import these to access their respective APIs. If you used these traits
in your functions as generic parameters, you can use the `I2s` type directly instead.

For example:

```diff
-fn foo(i2s: &mut impl I2sWrite) {
+fn foo(i2s: &mut I2s<'_, I2S0, Blocking>) {
     // ...
 }
```
