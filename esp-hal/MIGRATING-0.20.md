# Migration Guide from 0.20.x to vNext

## Cargo Features

A number of trait implementations which were previously feature-gated are now implemented by default. The following Cargo features have been removed:

- `async`
- `embedded-hal-02`
- `embedded-hal`
- `embedded-io`
- `embedded-io-async`
- `ufmt`

If your project enables any of these features, simply remove them from your Cargo manifest and things should continue to work as expected.

## HAL Initialisation

Instead of manually grabbing peripherals and setting up clocks, you should now call `esp_hal::init`.

```diff
 use esp_hal::{
-    clock::ClockControl,
-    peripherals::Peripherals,
     prelude::*,
-    system::SystemControl,
 };

 #[entry]
 fn main() -> ! {
-    let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
-    let system = SystemControl::new(peripherals.SYSTEM);
-    let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();
+    let (peripherals, clocks) = esp_hal::init(esp_hal::Config::default());

     // ...
 }
```
