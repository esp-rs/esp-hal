//! # Peripheral instance singletons (ESP32-H2)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `Peripherals` module provides singleton instances of various peripherals
//! and allows users to access and use them in their applications.
//!
//! These peripherals provide various functionalities and interfaces for
//! interacting with different hardware components on the `ESP32-H2` chip, such
//! as timers, `GPIO` pins, `I2C`, `SPI`, `UART`, and more. Users can access and
//! utilize these peripherals by importing the respective singleton instances
//! from this module.
//!
//! It's important to note that the module also exports the `Interrupt` enum
//! from the `ESP32-H2` `PAC (Peripheral Access Crate)` for users to handle
//! interrupts associated with these peripherals.
//!
//! ⚠️ NOTE: notice that `radio` is marked with `false` in the `peripherals!`
//! macro. Basically, that means that there's no real peripheral (no `RADIO`
//! peripheral in the PACs) but we're creating "virtual peripherals" for it in
//! order to ensure the uniqueness of the instance (Singleton).

use esp32h2 as pac;
// We need to export this for users to use
