//! # Peripheral instance singletons (ESP32-S2)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `Peripherals` module singleton instances of various peripherals and
//! allows users to access and use them in their applications.
//!
//! These peripherals provide various functionalities and interfaces for
//! interacting with different hardware components on the `ESP32-S2` chip, such
//! as timers, `GPIO` pins, `I2C`, `SPI`, `UART`, and more. Users can access and
//! utilize these peripherals by importing the respective singleton instances
//! from this module.
//!
//! It's important to note that the module also exports the `Interrupt` enum
//! from the `ESP32-S2` `PAC (Peripheral Access Crate)` for users to handle
//! interrupts associated with these peripherals.
//!
//! ⚠️ NOTE: notice that `psram`, `radio` and `ulp_riscv_core` are marked with
//! `false` in the `peripherals!` macro. Basically, that means that there's no
//! real peripheral (no `PSRAM`, `RADIO` nor `ULP_RISCV_CORE` peripheral in the
//! `PAC`s) but we're creating "virtual peripherals" for them in order to ensure
//! the uniqueness of the instances (Singletons).

use esp32s2 as pac;
// We need to export this for users to use
