//! # Peripheral instance singletons (ESP32-S3)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `Peripherals` module provides singleton instances of various peripherals
//! and allows users to access and use them in their applications.
//!
//! These peripherals provide various functionalities and interfaces for
//! interacting with different hardware components on the `ESP32-S3` chip, such
//! as timers, `GPIO` pins, `I2C`, `SPI`, `UART`, and more. Users can access and
//! utilize these peripherals by importing the respective singleton instances
//! from this module.
//!
//! It's important to note that the module also exports the `Interrupt` enum
//! from the `ESP32-S3` `PAC (Peripheral Access Crate)` for users to handle
//! interrupts associated with these peripherals.
//!
//! ⚠️ NOTE: notice that `psram`, `radio` and `ulp_riscv_core` are marked with
//! `false` in the `peripherals!` macro. Basically, that means that there's no
//! real peripheral (no `PSRAM` nor `RADIO` peripheral in the `PAC`s) but we're
//! creating "virtual peripherals" for them in order to ensure the uniqueness of
//! the instances (Singletons).
