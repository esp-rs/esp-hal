//! # Peripheral instance singletons (ESP32)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `Peripherals` module provides singleton instances of various peripherals
//! and allows users to access and use them in their applications.
//!
//! These peripherals provide various functionalities and interfaces for
//! interacting with different hardware components on the `ESP32` chip, such as
//! timers, `GPIO` pins, `I2C`, `SPI`, `UART`, and more. Users can access and
//! utilize these peripherals by importing the respective singleton instances
//! from this module.
//!
//! It's important to note that the module also exports the `Interrupt` enum
//! from the `ESP32` `PAC (Peripheral Access Crate)` for users to handle
//! interrupts associated with these peripherals.
//!
//! ⚠️ NOTE: notice that `psram` and `radio` are marked with `false` in the
//! `peripherals!` macro. Basically, that means that there's no real peripheral
//! (no `PSRAM` nor `RADIO` peripheral in the PACs) but we're creating "virtual
//! peripherals" for them in order to ensure the uniqueness of the instances
//! (Singletons).

use esp32 as pac;
// We need to export this for users to use
pub use pac::Interrupt;

// We need to export this in the hal for the drivers to use
