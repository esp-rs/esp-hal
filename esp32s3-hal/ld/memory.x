 Startup code uses the IRAM from 0x403B9000 to 0x403E0000, which is not available for static
 memory, but can only be used after app starts.

 D cache use the memory from high address, so when it's configured to 16K/32K, the region
 0x3FCF0000 ~ (3FD00000 - DATA_CACHE_SIZE) should be available. This region is not used as
 static memory, leaving to the heap.
