## [Documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/rust/esp-config/latest/)

## Usage

`esp-config` takes a prefix (usually the crate name) and a set of configuration keys and default values to produce a configuration system that supports:

- Emitting rustc cfg's for boolean keys
- Emitting environment variables for numbers
  - Along with decimal parsing, it supports Hex, Octal and Binary with the respective `0x`, `0o` and `0b` prefixes.
- Emitting environment variables string values

### Viewing the configuration

The possible configuration values are output as a markdown table in the crates `OUT_DIR` with the format `{prefix}_config_table.md`, this can then be included into the crates top level documentation. Here is an example of the output:


| Name                                | Description                                         | Default value |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **ESP_HAL_PLACE_SPI_DRIVER_IN_RAM** | Places the SPI driver in RAM for better performance | false         |

### Setting configuration options

For any available configuration option, the environment variable or cfg is _always_ set based on the default value specified in the table. Users can override this by setting environment variables locally in their shell _or_ the preferred option is to utilize cargo's [`env` section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#env).

It's important to note that due to a [bug in cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10358), any modifications to the environment, local or otherwise will only get picked up on a full clean build of the project.

To see the final selected configuration another table is output to the `OUT_DIR` with the format `{prefix}_selected_config.md`.

### Capturing configuration values in the downstream crate

For all supported data types, there are helper macros that emit `const` code for parsing the configuration values.

- Numbers - `esp_config_int!(integer_type, "ENV")`
- Strings - `esp_config_str!("ENV")`
- Bool - `esp_config_bool!("ENV")`

In addition to environment variables, for boolean types rust `cfg`'s are emitted in snake case _without_ the prefix.

## Defining Configuration Options

Config options should be defined declaratively in a file called `esp_config.yml`.

Such a file looks like this:
```yaml
crate: esp-bootloader-esp-idf

options:
- name: mmu_page_size
  description: ESP32-C2, ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 support configurable page sizes. This is currently only used to populate the app descriptor.
  default:
    - value: '"64k"'
  stability: !Stable stable-since-version
  constraints:
  - if: true
    type:
      validator: enumeration
      value:
      - 8k
      - 16k
      - 32k
      - 64k

- name: esp_idf_version
  description: ESP-IDF version used in the application descriptor. Currently it's not checked by the bootloader.
  default:
    - if: 'chip == "esp32c6"'
      value: '"esp32c6"'
    - if: 'chip == "esp32"'
      value: '"other"'
  active: true

- name: partition-table-offset
  description: "The address of partition table (by default 0x8000). Allows you to \
    move the partition table, it gives more space for the bootloader. Note that the \
    bootloader and app will both need to be compiled with the same \
    PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET value."
  default:
    - if: true
      value: 32768
  stability: Unstable
  active: 'chip == "esp32c6"'

checks:
  - 'ESP_BOOTLOADER_ESP_IDF_CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET >= 32768'
```

`if` and `active` are [evalexpr](https://crates.io/crates/evalexpr) expressions returning a boolean.

The expression supports these custom functions:
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|feature(String)|`true` if the given chip feature is present|
|cargo_feature(String)|`true` if the given Cargo feature is active|
|ignore_feature_gates()|Usually `false` but tooling will set this to `true` to hint that the expression is evaluated by e.g. a TUI|

`ignore_feature_gates()` is useful to enable otherwise disabled functionality - e.g. to offer all possible options regardless of any active / non-active features.

The `chip` variable is populated with the name of the targeted chip (if the crate is using chip specific features).

The conditions for `default` and `constraints` are evaluated in order and the first match is taken no matter if there is more.
This way you could have a catch-all condition as the last item by just specifying `true`.

`checks` is a list of checks which needs to pass for a valid configuration and is checked after all config values for the current config are applied.
You can access the currently configured values to check them.

For more examples see the various `esp_config.yml` files in this repository.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile when using the latest stable Rust version at the time of the crate's release. It _might_ compile with older versions, but that may change in any new release, including patches.
