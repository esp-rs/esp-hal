Bare-metal (`no_std`) hardware abstraction layer for Espressif devices. Currently supports, to varying degrees, the following devices:

- ESP32 Series: _ESP32_
- ESP32-C Series: _ESP32-C2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6_
- ESP32-H Series: _ESP32-H2_
- ESP32-S Series: _ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3_

Additionally provides limited support for programming the low-power RISC-V cores found on the _ESP32-C6_, _ESP32-S2_, and _ESP32-S3_ via the [esp-lp-hal] package.

For additional information regarding any of the crates in this repository, please refer to the relevant crate's `README.md` file. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please [open an issue], [start a new discussion], or join us on [Matrix].

If you are currently using (or considering using) `esp-hal` in a production environment and have any feedback or require support, please feel free to contact us at <rust.support@espressif.com>.

> This repository includes crates that are at various stages of maturity and stability. While many functionalities have already been implemented and are usable for most tasks, certain advanced or less common features may still be under development. Each crate may offer different levels of functionality and guarantees.

## Getting Started

For information relating to the development of Rust applications on ESP devices, please first read [The Rust on ESP Book].

For information about the HAL and how to use it in your own projects, please refer to the [documentation].

When browsing the examples, we recommend viewing the tag for the `esp-hal` release you are using to ensure compatibility, e.g. [v0.23.1], as the `main` branch is used for development and APIs may have changed in the meantime.
