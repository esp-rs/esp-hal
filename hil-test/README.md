## Quickstart

We use [embedded-test] as our testing framework. This allows us to write unit and integration tests much in the same way you would for a normal Rust project, when the standard library is available, and to execute them using Cargo's built-in test runner.

[embedded-test]: https://github.com/probe-rs/embedded-test

### Running Tests Locally

We use [probe-rs] for flashing and running the tests on a target device, however, this **MUST** be installed from the correct revision:

```text
cargo install probe-rs-tools \
  --git https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs \
  --rev 9bde591 --force --locked
```

Target device **MUST** connected via its USB-Serial-JTAG port, or if unavailable (eg. ESP32, ESP32-C2, ESP32-S2) then you must connect a compatible debug probe such as an [ESP-Prog].

You can run all tests for a given device by running the following command from the workspace root:

```shell
cargo xtask run-tests $CHIP
```

To run a single test on a target, run the following command from the workspace root:

```shell
# Run GPIO tests for ESP32-C6
cargo xtask run-tests esp32c6 --test gpio
```

If you want to run a test multiple times:

```shell
# Run GPIO tests for ESP32-C6
cargo xtask run-tests esp32c6 --test gpio --repeat 10
```

Another alternative way of running a single test is, from the `hil-tests` folder:
```shell
# Run GPIO tests for ESP32-C6
CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf \
PROBE_RS_CHIP=esp32c6 \
  cargo +nightly test --features=esp32c6 --test=gpio
```
- If the `--test` argument is omitted, then all tests will be run, independently if the tests are supported for that target, for this reason, we encourage using the `xtask` approach.
- The build target **MUST** be specified via the `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable or as an argument (`--target`).
- The chip **MUST** be specified via the `PROBE_RS_CHIP` environment variable or as an argument of `probe-rs` (`--chip`).

Some tests will require physical connections, please see the current [configuration in our runners].

sudo reboot
```

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new integration test file (`tests/$PERIPHERAL.rs`)
2. Add a corresponding `[[test]]` entry to `Cargol.toml` (**MUST** set `harness = false`)
3. Write the tests
4. Document any necessary physical connections on boards connected to self-hosted runners
5. Add a header in the test stating which targets support the given tests. Eg:
```rust
//! AES Test

//% CHIPS: esp32 esp32c3 esp32c6 esp32h2 esp32s2 esp32s3
```
If the test is supported by all the targets, you can omit the header.

6. Write some documentation at the top of the `tests/$PERIPHERAL.rs` file with the pins being used and the required connections, if applicable.

## Logging in tests

The tests can use [defmt] to print logs. To enable log output, add the `defmt` feature to the test
you want to run. Eg:

```rust
//! AES Test

//% CHIPS: esp32 esp32c3 esp32c6 esp32h2 esp32s2 esp32s3
//% FEATURES: defmt
```

Make sure to remove this addition before you commit any modifications.

> NOTE: log output is disabled by default. Enabling it can introduce some timing issues, which
makes some tests fail randomly. This issue affects all Xtensa devices, as well as ESP32-C2 and
ESP32-C3 currently.
