## Quickstart

We use [embedded-test] as our testing framework, which relies on [defmt] internally. This allows us to write unit and integration tests much in the same way you would for a normal Rust project, when the standard library is available, and to execute them using Cargo's built-in test runner.

### Running Tests Locally

We use [probe-rs] for flashing and running the tests on a target device, however, this **MUST** be installed from the correct revision, and with the correct features enabled:

```text
cargo install probe-rs-tools \
  --git https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs \
  --rev 9bde591 --force --locked
```

Target device **MUST** connected via its USB-Serial-JTAG port, or if unavailable (eg. ESP32, ESP32-C2, ESP32-S2) then you must connect a compatible debug probe such as an [ESP-Prog].

You can run all tests for a given device by running the following command from the `xtask` folder:

```shell
cargo xtask run-tests $CHIP
```

For running a single test on a target, from the `xtask` folder run:

```shell
# Run GPIO tests for ESP32-C6
cargo xtask run-tests esp32c6 --test gpio
```

Another alternative way of running a single test is, from the `hil-tests` folder:
```shell
# Run GPIO tests for ESP32-C6
CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf \
PROBE_RS_CHIP=esp32c6 \
  cargo +nightly test --features=esp32c6 --test=gpio
```
- If the `--test` argument is omitted, then all tests will be run, independently if the tests are supported for that target, for this reason, we encourage using the `xtask` approach.
- The build target **MUST** be specified via the `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable or as an argument (`--target`).
- The chip **MUST** be specified via the `PROBE_RS_CHIP` environment variable or as an argument of `probe-rs` (`--chip`).

Some tests will require physical connections, please see the current [configuration in our runners].

#### RPi Setup
```bash
# Install Rust:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- --default-toolchain stable -y --profile minimal
# Source the current shell:
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y pkg-config libudev-dev
# Install probe-rs
cargo install probe-rs-tools --git https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs --rev 9bde591 --force
# Add the udev rules
wget -O - https://probe.rs/files/69-probe-rs.rules | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/69-probe-rs.rules > /dev/null
# Add the user to plugdev group
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
# Install espflash
ARCH=$($HOME/.cargo/bin/rustup show | grep "Default host" | sed -e 's/.* //')
curl -L "https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/releases/latest/download/espflash-${ARCH}.zip" -o "${HOME}/.cargo/bin/espflash.zip"
unzip "${HOME}/.cargo/bin/espflash.zip" -d "${HOME}/.cargo/bin/"
rm "${HOME}/.cargo/bin/espflash.zip"
chmod u+x "${HOME}/.cargo/bin/espflash"
# Reboot the VM
sudo reboot
```

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new integration test file (`tests/$PERIPHERAL.rs`)
2. Add a corresponding `[[test]]` entry to `Cargol.toml` (**MUST** set `harness = false`)
3. Write the tests
4. Document any necessary physical connections on boards connected to self-hosted runners
5. Add a header in the test stating which targets support the given tests. Eg:
```rust
//! AES Test

//% CHIPS: esp32 esp32c3 esp32c6 esp32h2 esp32s2 esp32s3
```
If the test is supported by all the targets, you can omit the header.

6. Write some documentation at the top of the `tests/$PERIPHERAL.rs` file with the pins being used and the required connections, if applicable.
