options:
  - name: low-power-wait
    description:
      "Enables the lower-power wait if no tasks are ready to run on the
      thread-mode executor. This allows the MCU to use less power if the workload allows.
      Recommended for battery-powered systems. May impact analog performance."

  - name: timer-queue
    description:
      "The flavour of the timer queue provided by this crate. Integrated
      queues require the `executors` feature to be enabled.</p><p>If you use
      embassy-executor, the `single-integrated` queue is recommended for ease of use,
      while the `multiple-integrated` queue is recommended for performance. The
      `multiple-integrated` option needs one timer per executor.</p><p>The `generic`
      queue allows using embassy-time without the embassy executors."
