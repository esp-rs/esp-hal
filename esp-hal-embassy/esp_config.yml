crate: esp-hal-embassy

options:
- name: low-power-wait
  description: "Enables the lower-power wait if no tasks are ready to run on the
               thread-mode executor. This allows the MCU to use less power if the workload allows.
               Recommended for battery-powered systems. May impact analog performance."
  default:
    - value: true

- name: low-power-wait-wifi-perf-opt
  description: "If using wifi, this improves async ping times and may improve async throughput.
               Enables running the wifi stack just before going into low power sleep.
               This should cause any outbound packets to be sent earlier as we run the wifi stack before going to sleep.
               This should also cause inbound packets to be processed earlier since if waiting for an interrupt,
               and a radio interrupt occurs, then before going back to sleep we run the wifi stack which processes the incoming packet.
               Enabling this option allows setting esp-wifi tick_rate_hz to 1 which helps further reduce power consumption,
               as the wifi stack will run at a variable tick rate as needed rather than at a fixed rate."

               queues require the `executors` feature to be enabled.</p><p>If you use
               embassy-executor, the `single-integrated` queue is recommended for ease of use,
               while the `multiple-integrated` queue is recommended for performance. The
               `multiple-integrated` option needs one timer per executor.</p><p>The `generic`
